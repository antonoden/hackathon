Install node.js

Check for nodejs/node_modules/npm. Install npm if it doesn't exist(easy install). 

In commandprompt type: npm install socket.io

In .js files there is code looking like this example:
var Player=require("C:/Users/Anton/Documents/workspace/hackathon/server/Player.js");

Change all this to the location of your server-files. Check every the top of every .js file. 

Now server should be ready. Run server in command prompt:
node server.js
